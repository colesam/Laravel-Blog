# Laravel-Blog
A blog content management system powered by Laravel

<h3>Extended Description</h3>
<p>This project is a content management system for blogging using the Laravel PHP framework. I started this project to learn more about Laravel and MVC frameworks. The website will allow regular users to view blog posts, sign in, and create, edit, and delete comments on blog posts. The admin of the site will be able to sign in and create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as delete comments made by users.</p> 

<h4>Current Functionality:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Guests may view the public sections of the site</li>
  <li>Authenticated users may create, edit, and delete blog posts</li>
  <li>Authenticated users may assign a category to a blog post</li>
  <li>Authenticated users may manage the site-wide categories, including creating or deleting categories</li>
  <li>Guests may sign up for an account</li>
  <li>Registered users may log in, or request an email be sent to reset password</li>
</ul>

<h4>Future Functionality:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Differentiate between authenticated users and blog admin</li>
  <li>Assign one to many tags to a blog post</li>
  <li>Commenting available for authenticated users</li>
  <li>Allow for image uploads to blog posts</li>
