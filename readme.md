# Laravel-Blog
A blog content management system powered by Laravel

<h3>Extended Description</h3>
This project is a content management system for blogging using the Laravel PHP framework. I started this project to learn more about Laravel and MVC frameworks. The website will allow regular users to view blog posts, sign in, and create, edit, and delete comments on blog posts. The admin of the site will be able to sign in and create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as delete comments made by users.

Currently the site functions as if you are signed in as the administrator, because I am currently working on the authentication system. This repository includes a few screenshots to give an idea of how the site works at the moment.

Once the site is functional I will focus on adding some custom CSS styling to make the blog look nicer.
